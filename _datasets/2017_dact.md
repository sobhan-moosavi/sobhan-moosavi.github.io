title: "DACT: Dataset of Annotated Car Trajectories"
collection: datastes
permalink: /datasets/dact
excerpt: DACT contains two datasets of annotated car trajectories. Annotation is based on identifying _significant driving patterns_ in a trajectory (e.g., making a turn, a hard-braking event, etc.). These datasets are suitable for validation of trajectory segmentation approaches.

## Description
DACT contains two subsets of annotated car trajectories data. The dataset contains 50 trajectories which cover about 13 hours of driving data. In DACT, we manually specified significant driving patterns by using an interactive framework. A significant driving pattern can be a *turn*, *speed-up*, *slow-down*, etc. An example of a segmented trajectory with meaningful driving patterns specified using ovals is shown in the following picture. The annotation process consists of a crowd-sourcing task followed by comprehensive aggregation phases. The aggregation is done by two different strategies: Strict and Easy. For the first one, we used some strict constraints to aggregate crowd-sourcing results, while we used flexible constraints to generate the second subset of DACT.

## Format and Download
The data is presented in *csv* format, where we have two files, each based on one of the aggregation strategies. You can download these datasets from [here](https://figshare.com/articles/dact_dataset_of_annotated_car_trajectories/5005289){:target="_blank"}. In each file, we have the following columns: 

| Attribute | Description | Nullable |
|:----------:|-----------|:--------:|
| TripId    | The id of a trajectory | No |
| TimeStep  | The record number for a point of a trajectory | No |
| TimeStamp | The timestamp for a point of a trajectory | No |
| Speed | The ground velocity | No |
| Acceleration | The rate of change of speed | No |
| Heading | The bearing which is a value between 0 and 359 | No |
| HeadingChange | The change of bearing from the last observation | No |
| Latitude | The latitude coordinate of GPS observation | No |
| Longitude | The longitude coordinate of GPS observation | No |
| Annotation | Expert annotation which specifies the end point of a segment | Yes |
| SegmentType | The type of a segment | Yes |

## Application of Dataset
These datasets can be used to evaluate trajectory segmentation approaches, with the goal being to explore meaningful patterns, such as *turn*, *speed-up*, *hard-brake*, etc. Example of a research paper which used these datasets for evaluation of a segmentation algorithm can be find [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05733){:target="_blank"}.
