title: "A Dataset of Annotated Car Trajectories (DACT)"
collection: datastes
permalink: /datasets/dact
excerpt: DACT contains two datasets of annotated car trajectories. Annotation is based on identifying significant driving patterns (e.g., making a turn, a hard-braking event, etc.) in a trajectory. These datasets are suitable for validation of trajectory segmentation approaches.

## Description
DACT contains two subsets of annotated car trajectories data. The dataset contains 50 trajectories which cover about 13 hours of driving data. In DACT, we manually specified significant driving patterns by using an interactive framework. A significant driving pattern can be a *turn*, *speed-up*, *slow-down*, etc. An example of a semented trajectory with meaningful driving patterns specified using ovals is shown in the following picture. The annotation process consists of a crowd-sourcing task followed by comprehensive aggregation phases. The aggregation is done by two different strategies: Strict and Easy. For the first one, we used some strict constraints to aggregate crowd-sourcing results, while we used flexible constraints to generate the second subset of DACT. More information about this dataset may be find [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05219).
