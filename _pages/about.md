## About Me
I am a fifth year PhD student in Computer Science at the Ohio State University, advised by [Dr. Rajiv Ramnath](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~ramnath.6/). I am also a member of Enterprise Data Office (EDO) at [Nationwide Insurance](https://www.nationwide.com/) as a research scientist. My research interest is on applied machine learning and data mining, where I enjoy working with telematics, spatiotemporal, textual, vision, and many other types of data in terms of predictive analytic applications.
