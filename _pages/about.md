## About Me
I am a Research Scientist at Lyft. At Lyft, I work on routing and travel time estimation. Previously, I was a PhD student in Computer Science at Ohio State University, and was advised by [Prof. Rajiv Ramnath](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~ramnath.6/), [Prof. Srinivasan Parthasarathy](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~parthasarathy.2/), and also [Prof. Arnab Nandi](https://arnab.org/) (Columbus, Ohio 2019). My research interests are applied machine learning and data mining, where I enjoy developing and applying advanced models to address a variety of challenges in application domains such as telematics and transportation, spatiotemporal data mining, user behavior study, question-answering systems, and natural language processing. I also have a master's degree in Computer Software Engineering from [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en), advised by [Prof. Maseud Rahgozar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cj25iI8AAAAJ&hl=en) (Tehran, Iran 2012), and a bachelor in Computer Science from [Shahid Beheshti University](http://en.sbu.ac.ir/SitePages/Home.aspx) (Tehran, Iran 2009).
