This project is about analysis of drivers behavior by learning their significant driving patterns. The goal is to provide an end-to-end solution to identify _risky_ versus _safe_ drivers. Our identification process is based on extracting driving patterns and then analyzing each pattern within its context. To identify driving pattens, we leverage a novel _trajectory segmentation_ approach which is presented at [ACM SIGSPATIAL PhD '16](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3003824). Besides, we study each pattern with respect to extrinsic causes which may have relationship with the exatracted pattern, like _Traffic condition_, _Weather condition_, _Physical properties of routes_, etc. The results of current project may be used for Usage Based Insurance (UBI) programs. For more information, please visit [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05733.pdf) which is presented in the 25th ACM SIGSPATIAL Conference (2017).
