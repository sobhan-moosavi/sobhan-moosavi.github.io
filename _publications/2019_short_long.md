title: "Short and Long-term Pattern Discovery Over Large-Scale Geo-Spatiotemporal Data"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019_short_long
excerpt: This paper is a new framework to discovery short and long-term patterns over geo-spatiotemporal data (e.g. traffic, weather, etc.). Short-term patterns show propagation of geo-spatiotemporal entities which cause other entities to happen (e.g. _rain --> accident --> traffic jam_). Long-term patterns show influence of a temporally long-term entitiy on its spatiotemporal neighbhorhood (e.g. _major construction --> more traffic issue_).
