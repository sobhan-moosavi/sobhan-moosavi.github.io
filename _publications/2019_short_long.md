title: "Short and Long-term Pattern Discovery Over Large-Scale Geo-Spatiotemporal Data"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019_short_long
excerpt: This paper is a new framework to discovery short and long-term pattern from geo-spatiotemporal data. Short-term patterns show propagation of geo-spatiotemporal entities which cause other entities to happen. Long-term patterns show influence of a temporally long-term entitiy on its spatiotemporal neighbhorhood.
